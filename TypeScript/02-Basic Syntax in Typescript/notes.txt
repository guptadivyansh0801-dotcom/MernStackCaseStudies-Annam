What I Built:
- Variable for favorite fruit with console output
- Function that doubles a number
- Person class with sayHello method
- Added single and multi-line comments

Key Learnings:
- Functions need return type annotation
- void means function returns nothing
- Classes use constructor for initialization
- Comments work same as JavaScript

Challenges Faced:
- Forgot to add void return type initially
- class syntax was new to me
- Had to remember to call new before class
