What I Built:
- Enum for staff roles (Doctor, Nurse, Admin)
- Interface for Staff with id, name, role
- Array of staff members
- Function to print staff summary

Key Learnings:
- enum groups related constants
- interface defines object structure
- Arrays can have typed elements
- Interfaces make code more readable

Challenges Faced:
- enum syntax was new
- interface vs type alias confusion
- Accessing enum value by name
