What I Built:
- Quiz class with public, private, protected
- TimedQuiz extending Quiz
- Abstract Content class

Key Learnings:
- public: accessible everywhere
- private: only in same class
- protected: class and subclasses
- readonly: set once only
- abstract: must be implemented

Challenges Faced:
- Accessing private from outside
- extends vs implements difference
- Abstract class vs interface
