What I Built:
- Demonstrated block scope with let
- Created constant for country
- Showed variable shadowing in blocks

Key Learnings:
- let has block scope unlike var
- const cannot be reassigned
- Variables inside {} are separate from outside
- const is preferred for values that don't change

Challenges Faced:
- Initially confused block scope with function scope
- Tried to reassign const and got error
- Understanding shadowing took some time
