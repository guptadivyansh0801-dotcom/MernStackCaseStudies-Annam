What I Built:
- checkSign function for positive/negative/zero
- evenOrOdd function
- getGrade function with if-else-if
- provideFeedback using switch statement

Key Learnings:
- if/else works same as JavaScript
- switch needs break after each case
- Can chain multiple conditions with else if
- Return exits function early

Challenges Faced:
- Forgot break in switch cases
- Order of conditions matters
- Remembering === vs ==
