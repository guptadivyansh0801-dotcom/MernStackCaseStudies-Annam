What I Built:
- Created variables with type annotations
- Printed personalized greeting with my name
- Declared age variable and displayed it

Key Learnings:
- TypeScript adds types to JavaScript
- Use : string, : number to specify types
- Type errors show at compile time not runtime
- let and const work same as JS but with types

Challenges Faced:
- Initially forgot the colon before type
- Got error when tried assigning number to string variable
- Had to install TypeScript compiler first
