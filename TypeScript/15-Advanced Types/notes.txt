What I Built:
- Union type InstructorOrAdmin
- ReadonlyAssignment using Readonly
- StatsAsStrings using mapped types

Key Learnings:
- Union type: A | B means either
- Intersection: A & B means both
- Readonly makes immutable
- Mapped types transform shapes

Challenges Faced:
- Mapped type syntax [K in keyof]
- Understanding conditional types
- When to use utility types
