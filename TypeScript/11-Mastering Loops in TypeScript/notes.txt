What I Built:
- Transaction counter using for loop
- while(true) with break condition
- do-while for processing queue
- for-in to reset inventory
- Reverse order display with for loop

Key Learnings:
- for loop for known iterations
- while when count unknown
- do-while runs at least once
- for-in for object keys
- for-of for array values

Challenges Faced:
- Almost created infinite loop
- for-in returns string keys not numbers
- Remembering to increment counter
