What I Built:
- FeedbackBox generic class
- getFirstItem generic function
- Used with strings and numbers

Key Learnings:
- Generics use <T> placeholder
- T is replaced with actual type
- Same code works for any type
- Type safety is preserved

Challenges Faced:
- <T> syntax was confusing
- Understanding when to use generics
- Specifying type when calling function
