What I Built:
- Function to record quiz answers of any type
- Object to store multiple answers
- Tested with string, number, and array values

Key Learnings:
- any type accepts any value
- Useful when type is not known beforehand
- Loses type safety benefits
- Should avoid using too much

Challenges Faced:
- Tempted to use any everywhere
- Lost autocomplete when using any
- Had to be careful with type checking
