What I Built:
- Variables for city, temperature, isRaining
- weatherReport function with multiple parameters
- Tested type inference feature

Key Learnings:
- TypeScript can infer types automatically
- Don't always need to write type explicitly
- Template literals work with types
- Function parameters need types

Challenges Faced:
- Confused between explicit and inferred typing
- Forgot backticks for template strings
- Parameter order matters in function calls
