What I Built:
- Logger and DataService interfaces
- Application with injected dependencies
- Swapped implementations for testing

Key Learnings:
- DI: pass dependencies from outside
- Makes testing easier
- Can swap implementations
- Loose coupling is good

Challenges Faced:
- Understanding why DI is useful
- Constructor injection syntax
- Creating mock implementations
