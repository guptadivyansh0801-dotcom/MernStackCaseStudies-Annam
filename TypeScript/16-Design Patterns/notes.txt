What I Built:
- Singleton ConfigManager class
- Factory for notifications
- Observer pattern with EventEmitter

Key Learnings:
- Singleton: only one instance
- Factory: creates objects dynamically
- Observer: subscribe to events
- Patterns solve common problems

Challenges Faced:
- Private constructor was new concept
- Static getInstance method
- Managing multiple observers
