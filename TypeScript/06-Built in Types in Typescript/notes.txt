What I Built:
- Transaction processing function
- Used number, string, boolean types
- Handled undefined with nullish coalescing

Key Learnings:
- number for all numeric values
- string for text
- boolean for true/false
- undefined means not assigned
- ?? operator provides fallback value

Challenges Faced:
- Difference between null and undefined was confusing
- Had to learn ?? operator
- void vs undefined difference
