What I Built:
- insertOne for new menu item
- find with projection
- updateOne with $set and $push
- deleteOne by name

Key Learnings:
- CRUD: Create Read Update Delete
- insertOne returns insertedId
- find second param is projection
- $push adds to array

Challenges Faced:
- Query filter syntax
- Projection includes/excludes
- Update operators like $set
