What I Built:
- Aggregation pipeline for analytics
- $match, $group, $project stages
- Average rating per genre
- Filter by total views > 10000

Key Learnings:
- Aggregation is like data pipeline
- $match filters documents
- $group combines by field
- $project shapes output

Challenges Faced:
- Pipeline stage order matters
- $round for decimal precision
- Filtering after grouping
