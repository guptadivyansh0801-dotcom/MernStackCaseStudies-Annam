What I Built:
- Separate route file for contact
- Router middleware usage
- Mount router in main app
- Organized folder structure

Key Learnings:
- express.Router() creates router
- module.exports shares code
- app.use() mounts router
- routes/ folder for endpoints

Challenges Faced:
- Require path was wrong
- Router vs app difference
- File organization decisions
