What I Built:
- Model-View-Controller structure
- Separate folders for each layer
- Data models for entities
- Views for response formatting

Key Learnings:
- Model: data and database
- View: presentation/response
- Controller: business logic
- Clear separation of concerns

Challenges Faced:
- Deciding file structure
- Where to put validation
- Connecting layers together
