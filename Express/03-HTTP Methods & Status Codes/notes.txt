What I Built:
- Full CRUD routes for products
- GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE methods
- Status codes 200, 201, 400, 404
- Input validation

Key Learnings:
- GET retrieves data
- POST creates new resource
- PATCH updates partially
- DELETE removes resource
- Status codes show result

Challenges Faced:
- Remembering status codes
- req.body vs req.params
- Validation before processing
