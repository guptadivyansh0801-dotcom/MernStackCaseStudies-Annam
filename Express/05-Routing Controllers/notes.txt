What I Built:
- Controller classes for routes
- Separated logic from routes
- Clean route definitions
- Organized code structure

Key Learnings:
- Controllers handle business logic
- Routes just define endpoints
- Easier to test controllers
- Better code organization

Challenges Faced:
- Binding this in controllers
- Async error handling
- Choosing controller structure
