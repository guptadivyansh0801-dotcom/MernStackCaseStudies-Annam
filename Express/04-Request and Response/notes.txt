What I Built:
- Request and response handling
- req.body, req.params, req.query
- res.send, res.json, res.status
- Headers and cookies

Key Learnings:
- req has incoming data
- res sends response back
- Body needs middleware to parse
- Can set custom headers

Challenges Faced:
- Body parser middleware setup
- Query vs params difference
- Setting response headers
