What I Built:
- useMemo for expensive calculations
- useCallback for stable functions
- React.memo for component caching
- Performance improvements

Key Learnings:
- useMemo caches computed values
- useCallback caches functions
- React.memo skips re-renders
- Dependency array is important

Challenges Faced:
- When to use memoization
- Dependency array mistakes
- Over-optimization issues
