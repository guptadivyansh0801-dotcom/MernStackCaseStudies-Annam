What I Built:
- CommentBox component with test
- Test using React Testing Library
- Mock function for callback
- ESLint rule for no console.log

Key Learnings:
- render() mounts component
- screen.getBy finds elements
- fireEvent simulates clicks
- jest.fn() creates mock functions

Challenges Faced:
- Setting up test environment
- Query methods (getBy vs findBy)
- Async testing concepts
