What I Built:
- BudgetTracker with useReducer
- Typed income and expense entries
- Balance calculation with currency rates
- Actions for add income/expense

Key Learnings:
- useReducer for complex state
- Actions should be typed
- Reducer returns new state
- Prevent negative balance in reducer

Challenges Faced:
- Reducer action types syntax
- dispatch function usage
- State immutability concept
