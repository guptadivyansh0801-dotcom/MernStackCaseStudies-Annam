What I Built:
- Zustand store for notifications
- Actions: add, markAsRead, clear
- NotificationList component
- Filter for unread notifications

Key Learnings:
- Zustand is simpler than Redux
- create() makes the store
- set() updates state
- Selectors prevent re-renders

Challenges Faced:
- Zustand syntax was new
- Updating nested state
- Using selectors properly
