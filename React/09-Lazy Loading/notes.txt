What I Built:
- React.lazy for components
- Suspense with fallback UI
- Route-based code splitting
- Dynamic imports

Key Learnings:
- Lazy loading reduces bundle size
- Suspense shows loading state
- Split by routes or features
- Improves initial load time

Challenges Faced:
- Suspense placement issues
- Error boundaries needed
- Testing lazy components
