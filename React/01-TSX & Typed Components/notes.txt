What I Built:
- PortfolioSummary functional component
- AssetEditor class component with state
- Typed props using interface
- Form with controlled inputs

Key Learnings:
- Props need interface definitions
- FC<Props> for functional components
- State in class uses this.state
- onChange updates state values

Challenges Faced:
- TypeScript with React was new
- Class component syntax
- Handling form inputs with types
