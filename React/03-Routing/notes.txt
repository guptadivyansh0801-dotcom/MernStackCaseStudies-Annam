What I Built:
- Route with multiple params
- DoctorPatientDetails component
- Typed params interface
- Link navigation between pages

Key Learnings:
- useParams extracts URL params
- Params are always strings
- Need to validate and convert
- BrowserRouter wraps app

Challenges Faced:
- Type assertion for useParams
- Handling missing params
- Converting string to number
